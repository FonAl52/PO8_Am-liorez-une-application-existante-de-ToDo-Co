# Symfony MAJ Documentation
========
Requirements :
php 7.4.3 


## V3.1 to V3.4
  1. Open composer.json, change the version of symfony/symfony to ^3.4
  2. find your terminal and run:`composer update`

## V3.4 to V4.4 PreUpdate
  1. We are currently using Symfony v3.4 here, but we will need to address the 10 deprecated alerts before moving to Symfony V4.4
  * if you got more alert my advice is to copy the full message out, and paste directly into Google (ChatGpt can also help you).
  2. Let's take a look at these:

      - User Deprecated: Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Kernel::loadClassCache() is deprecated since version 3.3, to be removed in 4.4.
      - User Deprecated: Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Kernel::doLoadClassCache() is deprecated since version 3.3, to be removed in 4.4. 

        Solution : We can fix them easily enough by removing the line:

        // web/app_dev.php

        $kernel->loadClassCache(); // remove this line
        And also removing the line:

        // web/app.php

        $kernel->loadClassCache(); // remove this line

       ☝️ Here's a tip: remember to comment your code, especially when you disable a line of code, to remember why the code is commented out and possibly delete it once the project is up to date to optimize your code.
       Personally, I used this type of comment:
       // Comment after upgrading to Symfony V3.4.*

      ok let's continue

      - Using the unquoted scalar value "!event" is deprecated since Symfony 3.3 and will be considered as a tagged value in 4.0. You must quote it in "/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/PO8_Am-liorez-une-application-existante-de-ToDo-Co/app/config/config_dev.yml" on line 20.

      - Using the unquoted scalar value "!event" is deprecated since Symfony 3.3 and will be considered as a tagged value in 4.0. You must quote it in "/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/PO8_Am-liorez-une-application-existante-de-ToDo-Co/app/config/config_dev.yml" on line 23.

      - Using the unquoted scalar value "!doctrine" is deprecated since Symfony 3.3 and will be considered as a tagged value in 4.0. You must quote it in "/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/PO8_Am-liorez-une-application-existante-de-ToDo-Co/app/config/config_dev.yml" on line 23.

        Solution : This three are easy to fix:

        // app/config/config_dev.yml

        monolog:
            handlers:
                main:
                    type: stream
                    path: "%kernel.logs_dir%/%kernel.environment%.log"
                    level: debug
                    channels: [!event]
                console:
                    type:   console
                    channels: [!event, !doctrine]

        All this is saying is that !event and !doctrine needs to become "!event" and "!doctrine".

        // app/config/config_dev.yml

        monolog:
            handlers:
                main:
                    type: stream
                    path: "%kernel.logs_dir%/%kernel.environment%.log"
                    level: debug
                    channels: ["!event"]
                console:
                    type:   console
                    channels: ["!event", "!doctrine"]

      - The "framework.trusted_proxies" configuration key has been deprecated in Symfony 3.3. Use the Request::setTrustedProxies() method in your front controller instead.

        Solution : There is some documentation you may find helpful: [here](https://symfony.com/blog/fixing-the-trusted-proxies-configuration-for-symfony-3-3).

        Basically if you don't have any trusted_proxies set, which we don't, then all you need to do is remove the line from config.yml:

        // app/config/config.yml

        framework:
            # ... other stuff
        -    trusted_proxies: ~

      - Not setting "logout_on_user_change" to true on firewall "main" is deprecated as of 3.4, it will always be true in 4.0.

        Solution : add this line to your security.yml

        // app/config/security.yml

        security:
            firewalls:
                main:
        +           logout_on_user_change: true
                    anonymous: ~

      And the last 3 ones :
      - Autowiring-types are deprecated since Symfony 3.3 and will be removed in 4.0. Use aliases instead for "Psr\Log\LoggerInterface". X2

      - Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\DependencyInjection\Extension::addClassesToCompile() is deprecated since Symfony 3.3, to be removed in 4.0.

        Solution : The fix here is to ensure all our dependencies are as up to date as possible, for Symfony 3.4.

        In my case this is what my require block in composer.json looks like before switch to symfony V4.4 :

        "require": {
            "php": ">=5.5.9",
            "symfony/symfony": "3.4.*",
            "doctrine/orm": "^2.5",
            "doctrine/doctrine-bundle": "^1.6",
            "doctrine/doctrine-cache-bundle": "^1.2",
            "symfony/swiftmailer-bundle": "^2.6.4",
            "symfony/monolog-bundle": "^3.1.0",
            "symfony/polyfill-apcu": "^1.0",
            "sensio/distribution-bundle": "^5.0",
            "sensio/framework-extra-bundle": "^3.0.2",
            "incenteev/composer-parameter-handler": "^2.0",
            "doctrine/annotations": "1.7.0"
        },
        "require-dev": {
            "sensio/generator-bundle": "^3.0",
            "symfony/phpunit-bridge": "^3.0"
        },

        After composer update there no more deprecated alert.

## V3.4 to V4.4 Update
Ok, now we are ready to update to Symfony V4.4. Go to your composer.json file and change "symfony/symfony": "3.4.*" to "symfony/framework-bundle": "^4.4".

You will likely encounter a number of errors during your composer update. The best way to proceed here is probably to install a fresh version of Symfony 4.4 and check which dependencies are installed, then adjust your composer.json file accordingly.

After this work, mine looks like this:
    "require": {
        "php": ">=7.1.3",
        "doctrine/orm": "^2.6",
        "symfony/monolog-bundle": "^3.1.0",
        "incenteev/composer-parameter-handler": "^2.0",
        "doctrine/annotations": "^1.10",
        "symfony/console": "^4.4",
        "symfony/dotenv": "^4.4",
        "symfony/flex": "^1.3.1",
        "symfony/framework-bundle": "^4.4",
        "symfony/yaml": "^4.4",
        "twig/twig": "^2.16"
    },
    "require-dev": {
        "symfony/phpunit-bridge": "^3.4",
        "symfony/maker-bundle": "^1.31",
        "doctrine/doctrine-fixtures-bundle": "^3.4",
        "symfony/stopwatch": "^5.4",
        "symfony/web-profiler-bundle": "^4.4"
    },

Now we need to fit the new Symfony architecture like yo can see [here](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/4.4/UPGRADE-4.0.md)
